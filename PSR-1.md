##Basic Coding Standards
###Basics
1.  Your code **MUST** not have any appending `php` on your opening tags. it should only be as follows `<?` and `?>`. 
2.  You're required to add a closing `php` tag on the file. It is not your fault when the header is sent with whitespace. remember, its the interns fault.
3.  You are free to use any naming convention as you like. You may use snake_case, camelCase, PascalCase and so forth. 
4.  You are **NOT** to optimize your code when not needed.

###File Systems
1.  your file should **NOT HAVE** any ini configurations. All ini config should be set on the server. **IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT** if the server cannot allocate memory for your needs
2.  Tabbing is an option, and not required. You may use tabs / spaces or even mix them together in any design you want.
