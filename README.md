The official standards for YDD Development. 

An alternative and de-facto standard replacing the PSR conventions

Testing
-------

Don't bother with testability of your PHP Classes. Also don't use Namespaces, it looks unusual to non-OOP programmers. Ensure PHP Classes cannot be testable by mock tests or behavior driven tests. "Move fast and break things". 

Non-OOP
------
Use functions, it's faster. Group functions into files.
